                    <br>
                    <p id="articlefourpara">Concrete Rose’s debut event was a highly successful Charity Basketball game, which gathered funding for both a local park district and daycare in Chicago’s Roseland community. Since then Concrete Rose has aimed to provide a life changing platform for Chicago's youth. More specifically, Concrete Rose aims to put a spotlight on Chicago's youth with hopes to turn these talents into life long careers. Thus far, Concrete Rose has continuously met our aims through hosting numerous community-focused events in the Chicagoland area and creating a platform to showcase underrepresented stars in Chicago.

                    <h2 id="articlefourtitle">Our Founder</h2>
                    <p id="articlefourpara">Darrin Cotton Jr was born and raised on the southside of Chicago. He attended Brooks College Prep, where he thrived as a multisport athlete, being a standout in both Football and Basketball. DJ went on to attend the University of Mary in Bismarck, ND transferring to Davenport University in Grand Rapids, MI. At Davenport, DJ shined as a long, athletic defensive back finishing his final season with 30 tackles and 3 interceptions. In April of 2023, DJ Cotton earned his bachelor's degree in Sports Management and Business. DJ is currently working towards earning a Masters Degree in Business Administration in 2024 to pursue a career in Sports Business. Born and raised on the south side of Chicago, DJ has witnessed everything the city has to offer.

Through these experiences, he's realized that oftentimes individuals just need a platform to showcase their talents.
