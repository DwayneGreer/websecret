  <h2 class="sectiontitle">Past Events</h2>
  <h2>Wendell Smith Elementary School</h2>
  <img class="event_pics" src="fundingimg3.JPG">
  <p class="sectionpara">This year, Concrete Rose 773 had the opportunity to provide a game room for Wendell Smith Elementary School. The principal of the elementary school is my mentor and had an idea of creating a game room in his school for students who showed excellent behavior throughout the week. The “Seagulls Den” will be a space for both the students at Wendell and the greater Chicago community for entertainment, recreation and relaxation. The “Seagulls Den” provides recreational activities for Pre-k through 8th grade students including electronic indoor basketball hoops, table tennis, foosball table, ice hockey table, as well as popular board games and playing cards. We are so excited for this collaboration and the continuous impact that “The Seagulls Den” will have on the youth. We believe that every  elementary school across the Chicagoland area should have a resource similar to the Seagulls Den. Concrete Rose 773 sponsored the classroom filled with board games, arcade games, movies, snacks and a popcorn machine.</p>
  <h2>Chicago Urban Fashion Show</h2>
  <img class="event_pics" src="IMG_2399.jpeg">
  <p class="sectionpara">In the summer of 2021, Concrete Rose 773 hosted their first "Celebrating Chicago Through Fashion" pop up shop and fashion show. The event was a tremendous success designed for inner city brands to showcase their merchandise through a fashion show which ultimately turned into a pop up shop that allowed customers to buy their products. The event grossed hundreds of dollars for small brands and gave them a platform to display their talents. We aim to make this event annually in order to shine a light on young fashion designers throughout the entire city.</p>
  <h2>Back to School Picnic</h2>
  <img class="event_pics" src="fundingimg1.JPG">
  <p class="sectionpara">On July 30th 2022, Concrete Rose 773 hosted their 3rd annual Back to School picnic at Simeon High School on the southside of Chicago. With the help of family, friends and volunteers, we were able to feed over 100 kids from around the city. In addition to the food and drinks, we supplied the kids with backpacks filled with school supplies for the 2022 school year. The kids were able to enjoy bean bag toss, tic tac toe games, facepaint as well as a live DJ and Flag Football.</p>

<p id="lastpara">In 2020 Concrete Rose hosted their first Charity Basketball Game at Gwendolyn Brooks High School on the southside of Chicago. The game was a tremendous success and the proceeds were donated to Roseland Community Park and a local daycare in the area. The daycare was able to purchase books and learning tools for the kids while the park district was able to purchase new sports equipment including basketball/basketball nets, tennis rackets, softballs and soccer balls.  The next charity basketball game will take place in April of 2024 at Brooks HS. The proceeds will be rewarded as a scholarship to a Brooks senior who has displayed academic excellence and a desire to improve the environment. </p>
